# Notes from POC exploration
notes:
  - "NAICS 621492 (Kidney Dialysis) proved to be excellent test case with large multi-location chains"
  - "DaVita and Fresenius represent 93% of dialysis centers in POC dataset"
  - "All codes should use same discovery approach (HQ-based) as validated in POC"
  - "Expected ~100-200 multi-location companies across all 8 NAICS codes"
