The lack of proven success suggests poor outsourcing likelihood and challenging operational fit."
2211,"Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution",72,"Electric utilities operate operational facilities (power plants, substations, transmission facilities) where cleaning is a non-core support function, fitting OpenWorks' operational facility strength. The proven success ($4,840 revenue, 3 buildings) demonstrates outsourcing likelihood in this sector, though the low revenue-per-building ($1,613) suggests smaller facilities or limited scope. Score boosted to 72 from base ~60 due to proven presence, operational nature of facilities, and multi-location utility operators, though growth potential may be constrained by specialized technical areas and some utilities having internal maintenance teams."
2212,NAICS 2212 Industry,35,"Natural gas distribution utilities typically operate critical infrastructure with specialized safety requirements, regulatory compliance needs, and often maintain internal facilities teams for their operational facilities and offices. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 12,800 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry either doesn't outsource cleaning or has specialized requirements beyond standard commercial cleaning. The utility sector generally has sophisticated internal operations departments and union considerations that make outsourcing less likely."
2213,"Water, Sewage and Other Systems",72,"Water/sewage utilities operate essential infrastructure facilities (treatment plants, pumping stations, administrative offices) that require consistent cleaning as a non-core function. While OpenWorks has proven success with 2 locations generating $3,267 revenue, the industry presents moderate complexity due to industrial/operational environments and potential municipal ownership with procurement processes. The 19,966 locations nationwide offer scale, but many are small municipal operations - best opportunities are multi-facility regional utilities and water districts that outsource facility maintenance."
2361,Residential Building Construction,25,"Residential construction companies are poor-fit prospects for OpenWorks. These are project-based businesses with temporary job sites (not permanent facilities), highly fragmented single-location operators, and cleaning needs focused on post-construction cleanup rather than ongoing facility maintenance. The complete absence of OpenWorks revenue despite 576K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry does not outsource commercial cleaning services in a way that aligns with OpenWorks' recurring facility maintenance model."
2362,Nonresidential Building Construction,45,"Construction companies present significant challenges despite minimal OpenWorks presence ($6,723 revenue). These are project-based businesses with temporary job sites rather than permanent multi-location facilities, and construction firms typically handle their own site cleanup or use specialized post-construction cleaning services. The low revenue per building ($3,362) and only 2 locations served suggests these may be construction company offices rather than job sites, indicating limited scalability in this sector."
2371,Utility System Construction,65,"Utility System Construction represents operational/industrial facilities (field offices, equipment yards, maintenance facilities) where cleaning is a non-core function - strong alignment with OpenWorks' operational facility success. However, zero current presence despite 61K+ locations suggests either highly fragmented single-location contractors or project-based temporary facilities that don't fit the multi-location model.

4245,NAICS 4245 Industry,72,"Farm Product Raw Material Merchant Wholesalers operate distribution centers, warehouses, and processing facilities that align well with OpenWorks' operational facility expertise. These are multi-location businesses with utilitarian cleaning needs (grain elevators, cold storage, distribution centers) where cleaning is a non-core function likely to be outsourced. While zero current OpenWorks presence is notable, the operational/industrial nature and similarity to proven success in general warehousing (4931) and freight trucking (4841) suggests strong potential, though lack of proven success prevents a higher score."
4246,Chemicals & Allied Products Merchant Wholesalers,78,"NAICS 4246 (Chemicals & Allied Products Merchant Wholesalers) shows strong proven success with $62K revenue across 48 locations, demonstrating clear outsourcing patterns in warehouse/distribution operations. The proven success bonus (+10 points) and operational facility nature (warehouses, distribution centers) align well with OpenWorks' sweet spot, though the industry name suggests potential for some specialized chemical handling that could require protocols beyond standard cleaning. The 48 buildings served and healthy profit margin (14.7%) confirm this is a viable multi-location segment where cleaning is outsourced as a non-core function."
4247,Petroleum & Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers,72,"NAICS 4247 (Petroleum & Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers) represents strong potential for OpenWorks. These are operational distribution facilities (terminals, bulk storage, fleet maintenance) with utilitarian cleaning needs similar to proven success in trucking (4841) and warehousing (4931). Multi-location distributors outsource cleaning as non-core, though some facilities may have specialized safety protocols that require assessment. Zero current presence despite good theoretical fit suggests cautious expansion - pilot with mid-market regional operators first."
4248,NAICS 4248 Industry,72,"Beer, wine, and distilled alcoholic beverage merchant wholesalers operate distribution centers and warehouses that align well with OpenWorks' operational facility expertise. These are utilitarian, multi-location operations (6,289 locations nationwide) where cleaning is a non-core function, similar to proven success in general freight trucking and warehousing. Zero current OpenWorks presence despite strong theoretical fit suggests moderate caution, but the operational nature, regulatory cleanliness requirements, and multi-location distribution model make this an attractive expansion opportunity."
4249,Miscellaneous Nondurable Goods Merchant Wholesalers,45,"NAICS 4249 (Miscellaneous Nondurable Goods Merchant Wholesalers) covers diverse wholesale distribution operations including paper products, chemicals, and farm supplies. While these are operational facilities that could outsource cleaning, the complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 75K+ locations nationwide is a significant red flag - suggesting either highly fragmented single-location operators, owner-operated facilities with minimal cleaning needs, or industries that handle cleaning internally. Without proven success in this broad category and given the 'miscellaneous' nature indicating lack of operational consistency, this represents a speculative opportunity requiring careful market research before pursuit."
4251,Wholesale Electronic Markets and Agents/Brokers,45,"NAICS 4251 (Wholesale Electronic Markets and Agents/Brokers) represents intermediaries and agents who arrange transactions rather than operate physical facilities requiring cleaning services. The minimal OpenWorks presence ($763 from 1 location) suggests this is likely a misclassification or an office-only exception rather than a viable target market. This industry fundamentally lacks the operational facilities, multi-location footprint, and facility maintenance needs that drive OpenWorks' core business model."
4411,Automobile Dealers,62,"NAICS 4411 (Automobile Dealers) shows proven OpenWorks success with $51K revenue across 13 locations, earning the +10 proven success bonus and minimum score of 55. However, auto dealerships present mixed fit: showrooms require high-visibility cleaning (good fit), but service bays need specialized automotive cleaning beyond standard commercial scope. The moderate revenue per building ($3,934) suggests smaller facilities or limited scope, and dealerships often have internal staff for service areas, limiting outsourcing potential to front-of-house only."
4412,NAICS 4412 Industry,45,"NAICS 4412 covers other motor vehicle dealers (RVs, motorcycles, boats, ATVs). While OpenWorks has minimal presence ($1,400/1 location), these are typically small retail showrooms with limited square footage and cleaning needs. The industry consists mostly of single-location dealerships rather than multi-location chains, and cleaning is often handled by existing staff rather than outsourced, making it a poor strategic fit despite the large location count."
4413,"Automotive Parts, Accessories, and Tire Stores",45,"Automotive parts/tire stores present significant challenges for OpenWorks' model. Most locations are single-site franchises or small independent operators (not multi-location), and the retail environment combines customer-facing showrooms with industrial service bays requiring specialized cleaning (oil, grease, automotive fluids). Zero OpenWorks presence despite 267K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry either handles cleaning internally or has specialized requirements beyond standard commercial cleaning."
4441,NAICS 4441 Industry,35,"Building Material and Supplies Dealers (4441) represents a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks. These are retail environments (lumber yards, home improvement stores, hardware stores) that typically have internal janitorial staff as part of store operations, similar to other retail chains. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 390K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry does not outsource cleaning - retail stores generally view cleaning as a core operational function handled by store employees, not a service to outsource to third-party providers."
4442,Furniture Stores,45,"NAICS 4442 (Furniture Stores) represents retail environments that typically have internal janitorial staff or use local cleaning services rather than outsourcing to commercial providers. Despite minimal proven success ($2,904 revenue, 2 locations), the retail nature, consumer-facing environment requiring appearance-focused cleaning, and lack of multi-location operational complexity make this a poor strategic fit. Furniture stores prioritize showroom presentation over operational facility support, and the industry lacks the operational/industrial characteristics where OpenWorks excels."
4451,Grocery Stores,48,"Despite proven OpenWorks success with 5 locations generating $23,820, grocery stores present significant challenges for strategic expansion. The industry typically has internal janitorial staff (union considerations), requires specialized cleaning protocols (food safety, health department compliance), and operates on razor-thin margins making outsourcing less attractive. The low revenue per building ($4,764) and small footprint suggest these are likely smaller format stores or limited scope contracts rather than full facility management, indicating this is an opportunistic niche rather than a scalable growth market."
4452,"Specialty Food Stores - including meat markets, fish/seafood markets, fruit/vegetable markets, baked goods stores",35,"NAICS 4452 (Specialty Food Stores - including meat markets, fish/seafood markets, fruit/vegetable markets, baked goods stores) represents small-format retail with minimal cleaning needs and typically single-location operations. These are predominantly small businesses (bakeries, butcher shops, produce stands) that handle cleaning internally due to small footprints and food safety requirements requiring specialized protocols. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 180K+ locations signals poor outsourcing fit - retail food environments either clean internally or require specialized food-safety cleaning beyond standard commercial services."
4453,"Beer, Wine & Liquor Stores",35,"NAICS 4453 (Beer, Wine & Liquor Stores) represents small-format retail locations that typically handle their own cleaning as part of store operations. These are predominantly single-location or small chain retailers with minimal square footage and simple cleaning needs that store staff can manage. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 78,000+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry keeps cleaning in-house rather than outsourcing, making it a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks' multi-location commercial cleaning model."
4491,NAICS 4491 Industry,35,"NAICS 4491 appears to be retail-focused (likely furniture/home furnishing stores based on the code pattern), which presents significant challenges for OpenWorks. Retail environments typically have small individual footprints, high employee turnover affecting cleaning standards, and often handle cleaning internally or through local janitorial services rather than outsourcing to specialized providers. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 340,000+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry does not align with OpenWorks' operational/industrial facility sweet spot and likely represents poor outsourcing economics."
4492,NAICS 4492 Industry,35,"NAICS 4492 appears to be retail establishments (likely furniture/home furnishing stores based on the code pattern), which are poor fits for OpenWorks' multi-location B2B model. Retail chains typically have internal facilities teams or national cleaning contracts, and individual retail locations are too small/dispersed for OpenWorks' operational model. Zero current OpenWorks presence despite 298K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry doesn't outsource to regional providers like OpenWorks."
4551,Sporting Goods Stores,35,"NAICS 4551 (Sporting Goods Stores) represents retail locations that typically maintain cleaning in-house or use local janitorial services rather than outsourcing to facility management companies. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 157K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that retail stores don't fit the multi-location operational facility profile where OpenWorks succeeds. These are small-footprint retail spaces with simple cleaning needs, not the warehouses, distribution centers, or operational facilities where OpenWorks has proven success."
4552,Vending Machine Operators,35,"NAICS 4552 (Vending Machine Operators) represents a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks. These are typically small, distributed operations with minimal facility footprints - primarily warehouse/storage spaces for inventory and vehicle maintenance bays. The industry lacks multi-location centralized decision-making (operators service dispersed vending machines rather than managing multiple facilities), and the zero OpenWorks presence despite 336K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that these businesses either handle cleaning internally or have minimal facility maintenance needs that don't justify outsourcing."
4561,Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services,82,"NAICS 4561 (Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services) shows strong proven success with $152K revenue across 22 locations, demonstrating clear outsourcing behavior. These are typically multi-location operations (travel agencies, tour operators, online travel companies) with professional office environments that outsource cleaning as non-core. The proven revenue performance and healthy margin (15.2%) validates this as a solid fit, though the massive nationwide footprint (391K+ locations) suggests many are small single-location operations, requiring careful targeting of multi-location operators."
4571,Gasoline Stations with Convenience Stores,35,"NAICS 4571 (Gasoline Stations with Convenience Stores) represents a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks despite the large location count. These are typically small-footprint facilities (2,000-4,000 sq ft) operated by franchisees or small operators who handle cleaning internally or use local janitorial services. The complete absence of OpenWorks revenue despite 277,511 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry does not outsource cleaning to commercial providers - convenience stores prioritize low-cost, in-house cleaning by existing staff rather than professional facility maintenance contracts."
4572,Recreational Goods Stores,35,"NAICS 4572 (Recreational Goods Stores) represents retail storefronts with minimal cleaning needs and low outsourcing likelihood. Despite the large location count (143,044), these are typically small-format retail stores that either handle cleaning in-house with closing staff or use local janitorial services rather than professional facility management. Zero OpenWorks presence despite massive location count is a strong signal that this retail segment doesn't align with OpenWorks' operational/industrial facility focus and multi-location outsourcing model."
4581,NAICS 4581 Industry,45,"Gas stations (NAICS 4581) show proven OpenWorks success with 19 locations served, but face significant strategic challenges. The industry's 377,842 locations are predominantly single-site operators or small chains, making multi-location targeting difficult. The low revenue per building ($1,425) and convenience store/retail nature suggest limited facility footprint and cleaning scope, positioning this as an opportunistic rather than strategic growth market despite the proven outsourcing behavior."
4582,Shoe Stores,35,"NAICS 4582 (Shoe Stores) represents small-format retail locations that typically handle their own cleaning or use local janitorial services. With 50,571+ locations nationwide but zero OpenWorks presence, this signals poor outsourcing fit - retail stores rarely outsource cleaning as a strategic function, and individual shoe stores lack the multi-location centralized decision-making that OpenWorks requires. The small footprint and retail nature make this a poor strategic fit despite the location count."
4583,Building Material and Supplies Dealers,35,"NAICS 4583 (Building Material and Supplies Dealers) represents retail environments like Home Depot, Lowe's, and lumber yards. These are typically large-format retail stores that either have internal janitorial staff or use local cleaning services, not the operational/industrial facilities where OpenWorks excels. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 71,459 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this retail sector doesn't align with OpenWorks' multi-location B2B operational facility model."
4591,NAICS 4591 Industry,35,"NAICS 4591 appears to be warehouse clubs and supercenters (retail), which typically have internal facilities management teams and are dominated by large national chains (Costco, Sam's Club, Target) with centralized corporate cleaning contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 215K+ locations is a strong signal that this industry does not outsource to regional providers like OpenWorks - they either manage internally or use national contracts. The retail nature and corporate structure make this a poor fit for OpenWorks' multi-location regional approach."
4592,NAICS 4592 Industry,35,"NAICS 4592 appears to be Book Stores and News Dealers - retail environments with small footprints, typically single-location independent stores or small chains. These are consumer-facing retail spaces that rarely outsource cleaning (often handled by closing staff), lack multi-location scale, and show zero OpenWorks presence despite 34K+ locations nationwide - a strong signal that this industry keeps cleaning in-house. Poor fit for OpenWorks' multi-location B2B model focused on operational facilities."
4593,Direct Selling Establishments,35,"NAICS 4593 (Direct Selling Establishments) represents a poor fit for OpenWorks. These are typically small retail/office locations for direct sales organizations (cosmetics, supplements, MLM companies) with minimal facility footprints and often home-based or small storefront operations. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 43,000+ locations signals these businesses either handle cleaning internally, have minimal cleaning needs, or don't prioritize outsourced facility services - making this a low-priority market expansion opportunity."
4594,NAICS 4594 Industry,35,"NAICS 4594 appears to be an invalid/placeholder code (standard NAICS codes are 6 digits, not 4). Without knowing the actual industry, cannot assess fit. If this represents a retail or consumer-facing business category, OpenWorks typically struggles in retail environments due to after-hours scheduling complexity, high turnover, and preference for internal staff or regional cleaning companies. Zero current presence despite large location count (159,539) is a strong negative signal suggesting poor outsourcing likelihood or misalignment with OpenWorks' operational facility focus."
4595,NAICS 4595 Industry,35,"NAICS 4595 appears to be a container/packaging materials merchant wholesaler category. This represents a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks due to zero proven success despite 72,000+ locations nationwide - a strong signal that these businesses either handle cleaning internally or have minimal facility needs. Wholesale distribution facilities typically have basic operational cleaning requirements but often manage this in-house as part of warehouse operations, and the complete absence of OpenWorks presence suggests low outsourcing propensity in this sector."
4599,NAICS 4599,0,"NAICS 4599 is not a valid industry code in the standard NAICS classification system. The 45xx series covers Retail Trade, but 4599 does not exist as a defined category. Without a valid industry definition, it's impossible to assess outsourcing likelihood, facility types, or strategic fit for OpenWorks' commercial cleaning services."
4811,Scheduled Air Transportation,45,"Scheduled Air Transportation presents significant challenges for OpenWorks despite multi-location potential. Airlines require security clearances (TSA/airport access), have specialized cleaning protocols for aircraft and terminals, and typically maintain internal facilities teams or use national contracts with aviation-specific vendors. Zero OpenWorks presence despite being a professional, multi-location industry is a strong signal that outsourcing to regional providers is unlikely - this sector demands specialized capabilities beyond standard commercial cleaning."
4812,"Nonscheduled Air Transportation - charter flights, air ambulances, scenic tours",45,"NAICS 4812 (Nonscheduled Air Transportation - charter flights, air ambulances, scenic tours) presents significant challenges for OpenWorks. These operations typically involve specialized aviation facilities requiring security clearances, FAA compliance, and technical cleaning protocols beyond standard commercial services. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 4,406 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry either maintains internal facilities staff or requires specialized aviation service providers, making it a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks' core commercial cleaning model."
4821,Rail Transportation,85,"Rail Transportation is a PROVEN SUCCESS industry for OpenWorks with $717K revenue across 936 locations, demonstrating strong outsourcing patterns for operational facilities like stations, maintenance yards, and terminals. These are utilitarian, multi-location operations where cleaning is non-core, fitting OpenWorks' sweet spot perfectly. The negative margin suggests pricing optimization opportunities, but the substantial existing footprint (26% market penetration) validates this as a strategic target industry with room for profitable growth."
4831,"Deep Sea, Coastal, and Great Lakes Water Transportation",45,"Deep sea and coastal water transportation presents significant challenges for OpenWorks' model. These facilities (ports, terminals, marine operations) often require specialized maritime cleaning protocols, security clearances, and have complex operational environments with union labor considerations. The small market size (410 locations nationwide) combined with zero current OpenWorks presence despite operational facility characteristics suggests either high barriers to entry or poor outsourcing likelihood - likely both given maritime industry's tendency toward internal facilities management and specialized requirements."
4832,Inland Water Transportation,45,"NAICS 4832 (Inland Water Transportation) includes ferry services, tugboat operations, and barge transportation - specialized maritime operations with unique facility requirements including docks, marine terminals, and vessel maintenance facilities. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 11,923 locations nationwide is a significant red flag, suggesting these operations either handle cleaning internally (maritime crew/staff) or require specialized marine facility expertise beyond standard commercial cleaning. The maritime environment, safety regulations, and operational complexity make this a challenging fit without proven success indicators."
4841,General Freight Trucking,85,"General Freight Trucking is a PROVEN SUCCESS industry for OpenWorks with $66K revenue across 37 locations, demonstrating strong outsourcing patterns. These operational facilities (terminals, distribution centers, fleet maintenance) have utilitarian cleaning needs where cleaning is clearly non-core, and the multi-location nature (83K+ nationwide locations) provides excellent expansion potential. The $1,785/building revenue and 15% margin confirm sustainable service delivery in this blue-collar operational environment."
4842,NAICS 4842 Industry,72,"Specialized freight trucking (moving, storage, courier services) shows proven OpenWorks success with 2 locations served, demonstrating outsourcing viability in this operational sector. While the low revenue per building ($1,170) suggests smaller facilities or limited scope compared to general freight trucking (4841), the 109,848 nationwide locations represent significant expansion potential. Score reflects proven fit in transportation/logistics operations but tempered by smaller facility footprint and lower revenue density compared to general freight terminals and warehouses."
4851,Urban Transit Systems,72,"Urban transit systems (bus terminals, rail stations, maintenance facilities) represent strong operational facilities with 24/7 cleaning needs and multi-location potential. Similar to proven success in rail transportation (4821) and trucking terminals (4841), these are utilitarian facilities where cleaning is a non-core support function. However, public sector procurement processes, union considerations, and potential internal facilities staff create moderate barriers, preventing a higher score despite the operational fit."
4852,Interurban and Rural Bus Transportation,45,"NAICS 4852 (Interurban and Rural Bus Transportation) presents moderate challenges for OpenWorks. While these operators have terminals and maintenance facilities requiring cleaning, the industry is characterized by smaller regional operators with limited multi-location presence, often running lean operations with internal staff. The complete absence of OpenWorks revenue despite 4,287 locations nationwide suggests low outsourcing propensity in this sector, likely due to cost sensitivity and preference for internal maintenance teams at bus depots."
4853,"Taxi and limousine services operate dispatch centers, vehicle maintenance facilities, and fleet garages that require regular commercial cleaning - operational facilities where cleaning",72,"Taxi and limousine services operate dispatch centers, vehicle maintenance facilities, and fleet garages that require regular commercial cleaning - operational facilities where cleaning is non-core. While individual taxi operators are too small, fleet operators and limousine companies with multiple locations (dispatch centers, maintenance bays, driver facilities) fit OpenWorks' multi-location model. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 32,000+ locations suggests untapped potential in mid-sized fleet operators, though fragmentation and small independent operators present challenges."
4854,School and Employee Bus Transportation,72,"School and Employee Bus Transportation represents a strong operational fit for OpenWorks - these are multi-location fleet facilities (bus depots, maintenance garages, driver facilities) with utilitarian cleaning needs and 24/7 operations similar to proven success in trucking (4841) and rail (4821). The industry outsources non-core facility maintenance, operates regional fleets with centralized management, and lacks sophisticated internal FM departments. Zero current OpenWorks presence despite strong theoretical fit suggests untapped opportunity in an operationally-focused transportation sector where cleaning is clearly non-core."
4855,Charter Bus Industry,45,"NAICS 4855 (Charter Bus Industry) presents moderate challenges for OpenWorks. While these are operational facilities (bus terminals, maintenance garages) that could outsource cleaning, the industry is highly fragmented with many small operators, and the lack of any current OpenWorks presence despite 5,570 locations suggests limited outsourcing appetite. Transportation facilities can be good fits, but charter bus operations tend to be smaller-scale with less sophisticated facility needs compared to proven successes like freight trucking terminals or rail facilities."
4859,Other Transit and Ground Passenger Transportation,45,"NAICS 4859 (Other Transit and Ground Passenger Transportation) includes diverse services like limousines, shuttles, and charter buses. While some operators have multi-location facilities (garages, dispatch centers), the industry is fragmented with many small operators, and OpenWorks has zero proven success here despite the operational nature. The lack of any current presence in a transportation-adjacent sector (unlike proven success in trucking/rail) suggests either limited multi-location concentration or preference for internal/specialized cleaning, warranting a cautious moderate score until market validation occurs."
4861,NAICS 4861 Industry,45,"Pipeline transportation (oil, gas, water) involves specialized industrial facilities with technical requirements and safety protocols that may exceed standard commercial cleaning capabilities. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 4,387 locations suggests either limited outsourcing (internal maintenance teams common in utilities/energy) or specialized requirements that don't align with core competencies. Without proven success in similar pipeline/utility operations, this represents a speculative market with uncertain outsourcing likelihood and potential technical barriers."
4862,Pipeline transportation of natural gas,75,"Pipeline transportation of natural gas represents operational/industrial facilities (compressor stations, metering facilities, control centers) that align well with OpenWorks' operational facility expertise. These are 24/7 operations with utilitarian cleaning needs where facility maintenance is non-core, and the multi-location nature of pipeline networks (stations along routes) fits the ideal customer profile. While no current OpenWorks presence exists, the operational/industrial characteristics mirror proven success categories like trucking terminals and warehousing, though the specialized energy sector and potential union considerations warrant moderate caution."
4869,Other Pipeline Transportation,45,"NAICS 4869 (Other Pipeline Transportation) represents specialized infrastructure operations with only 898 locations nationwide, indicating a niche market with limited scale potential. While these are operational facilities that may outsource cleaning, the specialized nature of pipeline operations (safety protocols, remote locations, potential security requirements) and tiny market size make this a low-priority opportunity. Zero OpenWorks presence despite operational characteristics suggests either limited outsourcing or poor fit for standard commercial cleaning services."
4871,"Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Land",45,"NAICS 4871 (Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Land) includes tour buses, trolleys, and sightseeing operations - typically small operators with limited facilities beyond vehicle storage/maintenance. With only 673 locations nationwide and zero OpenWorks presence, this suggests very low outsourcing likelihood as these are often owner-operated businesses with minimal facility footprints. The lack of proven success despite being an accessible market indicates poor strategic fit for OpenWorks' multi-location commercial cleaning model."
4872,"Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Water",35,"NAICS 4872 (Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Water) represents tourist boat operations, ferries, and water tours - a highly specialized niche with seasonal operations, small facility footprints (docks/terminals), and marine-specific cleaning requirements. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 10,948 locations nationwide is a strong signal that these operators either handle cleaning internally or require specialized marine/waterfront services beyond standard commercial cleaning. The seasonal nature, small operational facilities, and lack of multi-location operators make this a poor strategic fit."
4879,"Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Other",45,"NAICS 4879 (Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Other) includes specialized tourism operations like aerial tramways, cable cars, and sightseeing vessels. While these are operational facilities that could outsource cleaning, the small market size (3,821 locations nationwide), highly seasonal nature, and often remote/specialized locations make this a challenging market. Zero OpenWorks presence despite operational characteristics suggests limited outsourcing likelihood or difficult-to-serve facilities."
4881,Support Activities for Air Transportation,55,"While OpenWorks has minimal proven presence ($6,440 from 1 building), this industry faces significant challenges including security clearance requirements at airports, specialized operational environments, and complex procurement processes. The industry includes diverse facilities from FBOs to ground handling operations, but many require technical protocols beyond standard commercial cleaning. Score capped at 55 due to specialized requirements, though minimal existing revenue prevents complete disqualification."
4882,Support Activities for Rail Transportation,45,"NAICS 4882 (Support Activities for Rail Transportation) includes rail yards, maintenance facilities, and switching operations - operational environments that align with OpenWorks' blue-collar facility strengths. However, zero current OpenWorks presence despite 28,088 locations nationwide is a significant red flag, suggesting these facilities likely have internal maintenance teams, union considerations, or are managed by parent rail companies with centralized facilities departments. The complete absence of proven success indicates substantial barriers to entry that override theoretical operational fit."
4883,Support Activities for Water Transportation,68,"OpenWorks has proven success serving 4 water transportation support facilities (ports, marinas, terminals), demonstrating these operations do outsource cleaning. However, the low revenue per building ($2,718) suggests smaller facilities or limited scope, and the industry's specialized maritime environment (salt exposure, dock facilities, security requirements) creates complexity beyond standard commercial cleaning. Score boosted to 68 from base ~55 due to proven outsourcing (+5 for revenue presence, +8 for operational/industrial fit), but capped below 70 due to specialized maritime requirements and small facility footprint limiting growth potential."
4884,Support Activities for Road Transportation,62,"Support Activities for Road Transportation (truck stops, weigh stations, fleet maintenance facilities, dispatching centers) represents operational facilities that should outsource cleaning as non-core. However, zero OpenWorks presence despite 53,027 locations is a significant red flag - this suggests either fragmented ownership (many single-location operators), internal cleaning staff, or facilities that don't prioritize professional cleaning services. Score reflects moderate potential but tempered by lack of proven success and uncertainty about multi-location concentration and outsourcing patterns in this sector."
4885,Freight Transportation Arrangement,72,"Freight transportation arrangement (freight forwarders, logistics brokers) represents a solid fit with proven OpenWorks success serving 4 locations. These are operational facilities (warehouses, distribution centers, offices) where cleaning is non-core, and the industry includes multi-location operators. Score reflects proven outsourcing (+5 bonus), operational facility fit, and strong market size (57,850 locations), though revenue per building is modest at $2,185 suggesting smaller facilities or limited scope."
4889,Other Support Activities for Transportation,45,"NAICS 4889 (Other Support Activities for Transportation) covers diverse support services including freight forwarding, packing/crating, and transportation arrangement. While some segments like freight terminals and logistics facilities could fit OpenWorks' operational facility profile, the industry's heterogeneity and lack of proven OpenWorks success signals uncertain outsourcing patterns. The zero current presence despite 3,678 locations suggests either limited multi-location operators, internal cleaning preferences, or facilities that don't match OpenWorks' sweet spot - warranting cautious exploration rather than aggressive pursuit."
4911,Postal Service,35,"NAICS 4911 (Postal Service) represents a challenging market for OpenWorks despite the large location count. The U.S. Postal Service operates as a government entity with centralized procurement, union facilities staff, and likely has national contracts or internal cleaning teams for its post offices and distribution centers. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 43,000+ locations is a strong signal that this industry either doesn't outsource cleaning or has entrenched national providers, making it a poor strategic fit for a regional commercial cleaning franchise."
4921,Couriers and Express Delivery Services,45,"NAICS 4921 (Couriers and Express Delivery Services) represents package delivery operations like FedEx/UPS facilities. While OpenWorks has minimal presence ($864 revenue, 1 building), this industry typically has internal facilities teams at major carriers or uses national contracts. The operational/logistics nature fits OpenWorks' strengths, but limited market penetration despite 7,257+ locations suggests strong incumbent relationships or internal management preferences that make displacement difficult."
4922,NAICS 4922 Industry,85,"Natural gas distribution facilities (pipeline operations, compressor stations, maintenance yards) are operational/industrial environments where cleaning is a non-core support function - ideal for outsourcing. These utilities typically operate multiple facilities across service territories with 24/7 operations requiring consistent facility maintenance, and the utilitarian nature of these facilities aligns perfectly with OpenWorks' operational cleaning expertise. Zero current presence despite strong theoretical fit suggests an untapped opportunity in a stable, regulated industry with predictable facility needs."
4931,Warehousing and Storage,88,"Warehousing represents an IDEAL operational facility type for OpenWorks with proven success ($95K revenue, 36 buildings). These large-footprint, 24/7 operational facilities treat cleaning as a non-core support function and typically lack sophisticated internal FM departments. The combination of proven performance, massive market size (118K locations), and perfect alignment with OpenWorks' operational facility expertise makes this a top-tier strategic opportunity."
5121,Motion Picture and Video Industries,85,"Strong proven success with $275K revenue across 40 locations demonstrates excellent fit. Production studios, post-production facilities, and entertainment venues align perfectly with OpenWorks' operational facility expertise - these are 24/7 operations requiring round-the-clock facility support where cleaning is clearly a non-core function. The solid revenue per building ($6,872) and healthy 14.9% margin confirm this is a sustainable, profitable segment with significant expansion potential given only 40 of 33,977 nationwide locations currently served."
5122,Sound Recording Industries,45,"NAICS 5122 (Sound Recording Industries) includes recording studios, music production facilities, and post-production operations. While these are operational facilities that could outsource cleaning, the complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 10,000+ locations nationwide is a significant red flag - suggesting either highly specialized facility requirements, small facility footprints, or strong preference for internal/local cleaning arrangements. Without proven success in similar entertainment production environments, this represents a speculative market with uncertain outsourcing patterns."
5131,"Book Publishers, Directory/Mailing List Publishers, Newspaper/Periodical Publishers",45,"NAICS 5131 (Book Publishers, Directory/Mailing List Publishers, Newspaper/Periodical Publishers) represents professional office environments where cleaning is typically managed through corporate facilities departments or national contracts. Despite minimal OpenWorks presence ($2,852 from 1 building), this industry shows poor strategic fit - publishing companies operate professional offices with sophisticated internal FM teams, not the operational/industrial facilities where OpenWorks excels. The single building served likely represents an outlier rather than scalable opportunity in this white-collar sector."

While OpenWorks has minimal presence ($6K revenue, 3 buildings), this likely represents small regional offices rather than core broadcast facilities. The low revenue per building ($2,114) and limited penetration suggest these are not ideal customers - media companies often have internal FM teams or require specialized cleaning protocols for technical equipment areas, making this a challenging market for expansion despite the proven foothold."
5161,Internet Publishing and Broadcasting/Web Search Portals,45,"NAICS 5161 (Internet Publishing and Broadcasting/Web Search Portals) represents professional office environments for tech companies, which typically have sophisticated internal facilities management or national cleaning contracts. Despite minimal OpenWorks presence ($1,605 revenue, 1 building), this industry shows poor outsourcing fit - tech companies either handle facilities internally or use enterprise-level providers. The professional office nature and likely presence of facilities departments makes this a challenging market for OpenWorks' multi-location operational facility model."
5162,"Book, Periodical, and Newspaper Merchant Wholesalers",35,"NAICS 5162 (Book, Periodical, and Newspaper Merchant Wholesalers) represents a declining industry with limited multi-location potential and no proven OpenWorks success. These are typically small-footprint warehouse/distribution operations in a sector facing digital disruption, making them poor strategic targets. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 3,804 locations nationwide signals low outsourcing likelihood and poor fit with OpenWorks' operational facility strengths."
5171,Wired and Wireless Telecommunications Carriers,62,"Telecommunications carriers operate operational facilities (cell towers, switching stations, network operations centers) that align with OpenWorks' operational facility strength, and proven revenue from 3 buildings confirms outsourcing occurs. However, the very low revenue per building ($1,048) suggests these are small facilities or limited scope contracts, and the industry includes both large national carriers with sophisticated FM departments and smaller regional operators - the proven success appears limited to smaller-scale opportunities rather than the multi-location operational facilities where OpenWorks excels."
5174,Satellite Telecommunications,35,"NAICS 5174 (Satellite Telecommunications) represents a highly specialized technical industry with only 269 locations nationwide, indicating limited scale opportunity. These facilities typically require specialized technical cleaning protocols for sensitive equipment and often have internal facilities management teams due to the critical nature of operations. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite the professional/technical nature suggests this industry either handles cleaning internally or requires specialized capabilities beyond standard commercial cleaning services."
5178,Other Telecommunications,35,"NAICS 5178 (Other Telecommunications) includes telecom resellers, satellite communications, and specialized telecom services - typically professional office environments with corporate facilities management teams. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 61,968 locations is a RED FLAG indicating low outsourcing likelihood, likely due to internal FM departments or national cleaning contracts at corporate headquarters. These are professional office settings where cleaning is managed centrally, not operational facilities where OpenWorks excels."
5182,"Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services",85,"Data centers and hosting facilities are PROVEN operational environments where OpenWorks succeeds - 24/7 operations requiring round-the-clock facility support with utilitarian cleaning needs. The $18,594 revenue from 3 locations demonstrates these facilities outsource cleaning as a non-core function, and the industry's technical focus (servers/data) means cleaning is clearly support infrastructure. Strong fit for multi-location data center operators and cloud hosting companies without sophisticated internal FM teams, though some large tech companies may have corporate facilities departments."
5192,"Book, Periodical, and Newspaper Merchant Wholesalers",35,"NAICS 5192 (Book, Periodical, and Newspaper Merchant Wholesalers) represents a declining industry with limited multi-location potential and poor strategic fit. These are typically small wholesale operations (book distributors, magazine wholesalers) with minimal facility footprints and low cleaning needs. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 53,908 locations signals this industry does not outsource cleaning - likely handling minimal needs internally or operating from small warehouses where cleaning is not a priority spend."
5211,Monetary Authorities-Central Bank,25,"Federal Reserve banks and central banking facilities represent highly specialized government operations with stringent security clearances, federal procurement processes, and likely internal facilities management teams. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 3,410 locations nationwide is a strong signal that these facilities either maintain internal cleaning staff or use specialized government contractors with security clearances. The combination of government bureaucracy, security requirements, and complete absence of proven success makes this a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks' commercial cleaning model."
5221,Depository Credit Intermediation (Banks),72,"Strong proven success with $129K revenue and 109 buildings demonstrates banks DO outsource cleaning despite being financial services. The $1,187/building revenue and 15.5% margin show profitable operations. Score capped at 72 due to industry pattern of larger banks having internal FM departments and corporate contracts, but proven performance warrants solid rating - likely serving regional/community banks and branch networks rather than major headquarters."
5222,Nondepository Credit Intermediation,62,"Nondepository credit intermediation (consumer lending, mortgage brokers, credit card processing) includes many small office locations that outsource cleaning, as evidenced by OpenWorks serving 8 buildings. However, the very low revenue per building ($542) suggests these are small offices with minimal cleaning needs, and the industry includes many single-location operations rather than the ideal multi-location chains. The proven success warrants a moderate score, but limited growth potential per location and fragmented market structure prevent a higher rating."
5223,Activities Related to Credit Intermediation,45,"Financial services industry with professional office environments that typically have internal facilities management departments or national cleaning contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 114,841 locations is a strong RED FLAG - indicates this industry manages facilities internally or uses enterprise-level contracts rather than outsourcing to regional providers. While multi-location potential exists, the lack of any proven success suggests poor outsourcing likelihood and misalignment with OpenWorks' operational/industrial sweet spot."
5231,Securities and Commodity Contracts Intermediation and Brokerage,35,"Securities and brokerage firms typically operate professional office environments with sophisticated internal facilities management teams or national corporate cleaning contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 190,060 locations is a strong RED FLAG - this indicates the industry either doesn't outsource to regional providers or has entrenched national contracts. These are corporate headquarters and branch offices with 'VP of Facilities' roles, not the operational/industrial facilities where OpenWorks succeeds."
5232,Securities and Commodity Exchanges,35,"Securities and commodity exchanges represent highly specialized financial infrastructure with sophisticated internal facilities management, security protocols, and likely national cleaning contracts through corporate procurement. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 645 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry maintains internal FM teams or uses enterprise-level service providers. These are typically Fortune 500-scale operations (NYSE, NASDAQ, CME) with complex security clearances and professional office environments that don't align with OpenWorks' operational facility sweet spot."
5239,Other Financial Investment Activities,58,"While OpenWorks has minimal proven presence (2 buildings, $4,942 revenue), this financial investment sector typically consists of professional offices with sophisticated facilities management or national cleaning contracts. The very low revenue per building ($2,471) and small footprint suggest these are likely small satellite offices rather than the corporate headquarters that dominate this NAICS code. Score reflects proven outsourcing (+5 points for minimal revenue) but tempered by industry pattern of internal FM teams and professional office environments that typically don't align with OpenWorks' operational facility sweet spot."
5241,Insurance Carriers,35,"Insurance carriers represent professional office environments where corporate headquarters typically maintain internal facilities management departments or national cleaning contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 79,000+ locations is a strong RED FLAG - this indicates insurance companies either handle cleaning internally or use enterprise-level national contracts that OpenWorks cannot compete for. The professional office nature, sophisticated FM infrastructure, and complete absence of proven success make this a poor strategic fit despite the large location count."
5242,"Agencies, Brokerages, and Other Insurance Related Activities",35,"Insurance agencies and brokerages are professional office environments that typically maintain internal facilities management or use national cleaning contracts through corporate real estate departments. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 741K+ locations is a strong RED FLAG - this massive market would show some penetration if outsourcing to regional providers was common. These are exactly the type of professional services firms (like banks, securities firms) that prefer established national vendors or internal staff over regional commercial cleaning providers."
5251,Insurance and Employee Benefit Funds,35,"NAICS 5251 (Insurance and Employee Benefit Funds) represents insurance carriers, pension funds, and benefit trust funds - typically corporate office environments with sophisticated internal facilities management teams or national cleaning contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 7,351 locations nationwide is a strong RED FLAG indicating these organizations don't outsource to regional providers like OpenWorks. These are financial institutions with professional office settings that prefer large national vendors or have internal FM departments, making them poor strategic targets."
5259,Other Investment Pools and Funds,45,"NAICS 5259 (Other Investment Pools and Funds) represents financial services firms managing investment vehicles - typically professional office environments with sophisticated corporate infrastructure. Zero OpenWorks presence despite being a professional services sector is a red flag, suggesting these firms either have internal facilities management teams or use national cleaning contracts through corporate real estate departments. The financial services nature and likely Fortune 500/institutional scale makes this a poor fit for OpenWorks' mid-market, multi-location operational facility model."
5311,Lessors of Real Estate,72,"Real estate lessors show proven OpenWorks success ($119K revenue, 39 buildings) indicating outsourcing likelihood, but this is a mixed category requiring careful segmentation. Strong fit for property management companies managing multi-location portfolios (office parks, retail centers, industrial properties) where cleaning is outsourced to tenant-serving lessors. However, many lessors are small landlords or pass cleaning responsibility to tenants, and large REITs often have sophisticated internal facilities teams or national contracts, limiting addressable market despite proven revenue."
5312,Offices of Real Estate Agents and Brokers,68,"Real estate offices represent a moderate fit with proven OpenWorks success ($48K revenue, 14 locations) demonstrating outsourcing viability in this sector. The massive market size (439K+ locations) and multi-location brokerage firms align with ICP, though many are small independent offices. Score boosted from base 60 to 68 due to proven revenue, but capped below 75 as these are professional office environments where larger brokerages may have corporate FM arrangements and smaller offices have minimal cleaning needs."
5313,Activities Related to Real Estate,72,"Strong proven success with $56K revenue and 25 buildings demonstrates real outsourcing in this sector. Property management companies and real estate offices are multi-location operators that outsource cleaning as non-core, though some larger REITs may have internal FM teams. The $2,240/building revenue and solid margins indicate good operational fit, earning +10 proven success bonus and benefiting from multi-location nature of property management firms."
5321,Automotive Equipment Rental and Leasing,45,"NAICS 5321 (Automotive Equipment Rental and Leasing) includes car rental agencies, truck rental, and equipment leasing facilities. While OpenWorks has minimal presence ($3,323 revenue, 3 buildings), these are typically small retail/counter locations with limited cleaning needs and often handled by staff. The low revenue per building ($1,108) suggests small facilities or minimal service scope, and this industry typically doesn't outsource cleaning as a strategic priority - most locations are small storefronts or lots where cleaning is incidental rather than a core facility need."
5322,NAICS 5322 Industry,45,"Consumer Goods Rental (equipment rental, party/event rental, formal wear rental) represents a challenging fit for OpenWorks. While multi-location rental chains exist, these are typically smaller retail/showroom environments with limited square footage and often owner-operated with internal cleaning. The complete absence of OpenWorks revenue despite 64,370 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry either handles cleaning internally or has minimal outsourcing needs - rental businesses prioritize equipment maintenance over facility services and rarely view cleaning as a strategic outsourcing opportunity."
5323,General Rental Centers,45,"NAICS 5323 (General Rental Centers) includes equipment rental businesses with showrooms, warehouses, and maintenance facilities that could theoretically need cleaning services. However, the complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 33,380 nationwide locations is a strong RED FLAG - this suggests the industry either handles cleaning internally, has minimal facility needs, or doesn't prioritize outsourced cleaning. Without proven success data and given the likely small-footprint retail/warehouse hybrid nature of these facilities, this represents a speculative market with uncertain outsourcing likelihood."
5324,Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment Rental and Leasing,72,"NAICS 5324 (Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment Rental and Leasing) shows proven OpenWorks success with 13 locations served, demonstrating this industry outsources cleaning as a non-core function. These are operational/industrial facilities (equipment yards, rental centers, service facilities) that align well with OpenWorks' strength in utilitarian environments. Score boosted from base 65 to 72 due to proven revenue generation, though limited to mid-70s as these are typically smaller-footprint facilities with moderate cleaning needs rather than the large-scale operations where OpenWorks excels most."
5331,Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets,35,"NAICS 5331 (Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets) covers companies that lease intellectual property like patents, trademarks, and franchises - not physical facilities. This industry has minimal facility footprint beyond small corporate offices, making it a poor fit for commercial cleaning services. Zero OpenWorks presence confirms these businesses don't outsource cleaning at scale."
5411,Legal Services,45,"Legal services represents professional office environments where firms typically have sophisticated facilities management or national cleaning contracts. Despite minimal OpenWorks presence ($3K revenue, 3 buildings), this is a highly fragmented market (479K locations) dominated by small law firms that may outsource. However, the extremely low revenue per building ($1K/year) and lack of scale suggests these are very small offices or occasional services, not the multi-location operational facilities where OpenWorks excels. Professional services firms prioritize appearance/prestige and often have established vendor relationships that are difficult to displace."
5412,"Accounting, Tax Preparation, Bookkeeping, and Payroll Services",45,"Despite minimal OpenWorks presence ($786 revenue, 1 building), this is a professional services industry where firms typically operate small offices with limited cleaning needs. Accounting/tax firms often have internal staff handle basic cleaning or use local janitorial services rather than outsourcing to multi-location providers. The single-location success likely represents a small local firm rather than a scalable multi-location opportunity, and the industry lacks the operational facility characteristics where OpenWorks excels."
5413,"Architectural, Engineering, and Related Services",68,"OpenWorks has proven success serving 11 A&E firm locations, demonstrating these professional offices do outsource cleaning. However, this is a professional services environment where larger firms often have internal facilities management or national contracts, limiting scalability. The $1,809/building revenue suggests smaller offices rather than large multi-location firms, indicating opportunities exist primarily in the regional/mid-market segment rather than major engineering corporations."
5414,Specialized Design Services,35,"Specialized Design Services (architecture, interior design, graphic design firms) are typically small professional offices with minimal facility footprints and sophisticated aesthetic standards. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 95,783 locations is a strong signal that these firms either handle cleaning internally, use boutique services, or have minimal cleaning needs. These are professional service environments that prioritize appearance/prestige and likely prefer specialized providers or have internal arrangements - not the operational/industrial facilities where OpenWorks excels."
5415,Computer Systems Design and Related Services,45,"Computer systems design firms typically operate from professional office environments where cleaning is often handled through corporate facilities management or national office cleaning contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 169,625 locations nationwide is a RED FLAG - this suggests the industry either maintains internal FM teams, uses national contracts, or has low outsourcing propensity. While some smaller tech firms and regional IT service providers might outsource, the lack of any proven success indicates this is not a natural fit for OpenWorks' operational/industrial facility strength."
5416,"Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services",45,"Professional consulting firms typically operate from corporate office environments and often have internal facilities management or national cleaning contracts through corporate real estate departments. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 452K+ locations is a RED FLAG - this suggests low outsourcing likelihood to regional providers like OpenWorks. While some smaller multi-location consulting firms might outsource, the professional office nature and lack of proven success indicates this is not a strategic priority market."
5417,Scientific Research and Development Services,48,"Despite minimal OpenWorks presence ($3.4K revenue, 2 buildings), scientific R&D facilities present significant challenges: many require specialized cleanroom protocols, biosafety compliance, and hazardous material handling beyond standard commercial cleaning. The low revenue per building ($1,724) and minimal penetration suggest these are likely administrative offices rather than lab facilities. While some R&D companies outsource office cleaning, core lab environments typically require specialized vendors or internal staff with technical training, making this a poor strategic fit for expansion despite the large market size."
5418,"Advertising, Public Relations, and Related Services",48,"Despite minimal proven success ($3,397 revenue, 3 buildings), advertising/PR agencies are professional office environments that typically have internal facilities management or national cleaning contracts. The extremely low revenue per building ($1,132) and small footprint suggest these are small agencies without multi-location operations. This industry represents professional services firms that don't align with OpenWorks' operational/industrial sweet spot, and the lack of meaningful revenue despite 408K+ locations nationwide signals poor outsourcing fit for standard commercial cleaning."
5419,"Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services",68,"OpenWorks has proven success with $47K revenue across 20 locations, demonstrating this industry does outsource cleaning services. However, the low revenue per building ($2,351) suggests smaller facilities or limited scope engagements. This broad NAICS category (5419) includes diverse professional services firms that may have varying outsourcing patterns - some are multi-location operators ideal for OpenWorks, while others are single-office professional firms with less attractive economics. The proven presence earns a solid score, but the fragmented nature and professional office environment prevents a higher rating without more multi-location operational facilities."
5511,Management of Companies and Enterprises,35,"Management of Companies (holding companies, corporate headquarters) represents professional office environments with sophisticated internal facilities management departments and national cleaning contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 39,442 locations is a strong RED FLAG - these are exactly the corporate headquarters with VPs of Facilities that manage cleaning in-house or through enterprise agreements. This is the antithesis of OpenWorks' sweet spot: Fortune 500/large corporate environments where cleaning decisions are made by facilities professionals, not operational managers seeking to outsource non-core functions."
5611,Office Administrative Services,62,"Office Administrative Services represents professional office environments that typically outsource cleaning as non-core. However, minimal OpenWorks presence ($5.8K revenue, 1 building) despite 53K+ nationwide locations suggests limited multi-location concentration or strong competition from national office cleaning contracts. The proven outsourcing likelihood earns a moderate score, but lack of scale indicates this isn't a priority growth segment compared to operational/industrial facilities where OpenWorks demonstrates stronger traction."
5612,Facilities Support Services,45,"Despite proven OpenWorks success ($70K revenue, 7 buildings), this NAICS represents facilities management COMPETITORS, not customers. These are companies that provide facility support services themselves - they ARE the cleaning/maintenance providers, not businesses that outsource cleaning. This is a competitor category, not a target market, making it strategically inappropriate despite the revenue data suggesting some edge cases where facility support companies outsource their own office cleaning."
5613,Employment Services,62,"Employment Services (staffing agencies, temp agencies, recruiting firms) represents a moderate fit with proven but minimal OpenWorks presence ($1,628 from 1 location). These are typically professional office environments where cleaning is outsourced as non-core, and the 78,138 locations suggest multi-location operators exist. However, the extremely low revenue despite proven presence indicates small office footprints, limited cleaning needs, or strong competition from national office cleaning contracts - this is more of a small professional office play than OpenWorks' operational facility sweet spot."
5614,Business Support Services,72,"Business Support Services shows proven OpenWorks success with $43K revenue across 7 locations, demonstrating outsourcing likelihood and multi-location fit. However, this broad category includes diverse facility types from call centers (strong fit) to professional office environments (weaker fit), and the moderate revenue per building ($6,201) suggests smaller facilities or mixed operational complexity. Score reflects proven success bonus (+10) balanced against industry heterogeneity and potential presence of professional office segments with internal FM capabilities."
5615,Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services,45,"Travel agencies are typically small professional office environments (1-5 employees per location) with minimal cleaning needs and low outsourcing likelihood. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 78K+ locations nationwide is a strong RED FLAG - this suggests the industry either handles cleaning internally or uses local residential-style services rather than commercial contracts. The fragmented, small-office nature and lack of proven success makes this a poor strategic fit despite the location count."
5616,Investigation and Security Services,45,"Investigation and security services firms operate offices, training facilities, and operations centers that could need cleaning, but this industry faces significant challenges for OpenWorks. Zero current presence despite 105K+ locations is a RED FLAG - security firms likely handle facilities in-house (security-conscious culture), have minimal facility footprints (field-based workforce), or use vetted vendors due to access/clearance concerns. The lack of any OpenWorks penetration suggests low outsourcing propensity and poor strategic fit despite the location count."
5617,Services to Buildings and Dwellings,15,"This NAICS code represents OpenWorks' direct COMPETITORS - janitorial services, carpet cleaning, window cleaning, and other building service contractors. These are service providers, not facility owners/operators who would hire OpenWorks. Zero presence confirms these are competitors, not customers. This industry should be excluded from target market analysis."
5619,Other Support Services,45,"NAICS 5619 is a catch-all category covering diverse support services (travel agencies, convention services, repossession, court reporting, etc.) with highly variable facility types and cleaning needs. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 118,921 locations signals this is NOT a natural outsourcing market - likely small offices, home-based businesses, or operations with minimal facility footprints. The heterogeneous nature makes it difficult to target systematically, and absence of any proven success suggests poor strategic fit for OpenWorks' multi-location operational facility model."
5621,Waste Collection,85,"Strong proven success with $67K revenue across 59 locations demonstrates waste collection facilities actively outsource cleaning. These operational/industrial facilities (transfer stations, fleet maintenance, sorting facilities) have utilitarian cleaning needs that align perfectly with OpenWorks' core competency - heavy-duty, non-specialized cleaning for blue-collar operational environments. The 27K+ nationwide locations offer significant expansion potential in a sector where OpenWorks has already validated product-market fit."
5622,Waste Treatment and Disposal,62,"Waste treatment and disposal facilities share operational characteristics with proven OpenWorks success in waste collection (5621), featuring industrial facilities, 24/7 operations, and utilitarian cleaning needs. However, zero current OpenWorks presence despite 29,367 locations suggests potential barriers - likely specialized cleaning requirements (hazmat protocols, contamination control) or internal facilities staff at larger operators. Score reflects moderate potential in smaller/regional operators with standard facility areas, but caution warranted given lack of proven success in this specific segment."
5629,Remediation and Other Waste Management Services,68,"Remediation and waste management facilities represent operational/industrial environments where cleaning is a non-core support function, aligning well with OpenWorks' proven success in waste collection (5621). However, the minimal current presence ($1K revenue, 1 building) suggests limited penetration despite 47,543 potential locations, and some facilities may have specialized hazmat/contamination protocols beyond standard commercial cleaning. The industry shows promise for operational facilities (transfer stations, equipment yards) but requires careful qualification to avoid specialized remediation sites requiring technical expertise."
6111,Elementary and Secondary Schools,92,"Elementary and Secondary Schools (6111) represents OpenWorks' SWEET SPOT with exceptional proven success ($910K revenue, 164 buildings). Multi-location school districts are ideal: they outsource cleaning as non-core, have centralized decision-making, operate utilitarian facilities requiring round-the-clock support, and lack sophisticated internal FM departments. The strong revenue per building ($5,550) and healthy margins (15.2%) demonstrate excellent operational fit, while the massive addressable market (230,965 locations) offers substantial growth runway in a proven vertical."
6112,Junior Colleges,78,"Junior colleges represent strong strategic fit as multi-campus educational institutions that typically outsource cleaning as a non-core function. Similar to K-12 districts (proven OpenWorks success), they have centralized decision-making, standard commercial cleaning needs, and operational facilities requiring consistent service. Score reflects high outsourcing likelihood and multi-location fit, though slightly lower than K-12 due to lack of proven OpenWorks presence and potential for some internal facilities staff at larger community college systems."
6113,"Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools",78,"Strong strategic fit as multi-campus universities and college systems align well with OpenWorks' multi-location model and centralized decision-making preference. Educational facilities require consistent, reliable cleaning as a non-core function that institutions readily outsource, similar to proven success in K-12 districts (6111). However, score capped below K-12's 80+ due to zero current OpenWorks presence (no proven success signal) and potential for larger universities to have internal facilities management departments, though mid-sized colleges and regional university systems represent excellent expansion opportunities."
6114,Business Schools and Computer and Management Training,62,"Business schools and training centers represent a moderate fit with mixed signals. While these are multi-location educational facilities that outsource cleaning as non-core, the complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 20,828 locations nationwide is a significant red flag suggesting lower outsourcing likelihood than K-12 schools. Many are smaller operations (single instructors, shared office spaces) or part of larger corporate training departments with existing facility contracts, making them harder to penetrate than traditional school districts with centralized decision-making."
6115,Technical and Trade Schools,78,"Technical and trade schools are an excellent fit for OpenWorks, combining proven success (existing revenue and buildings served) with strong fundamentals: multi-location operators, education sector outsourcing patterns, and operational facilities focused on training rather than prestige. The 25,860 nationwide locations represent significant expansion potential beyond the current 2 buildings, and these schools typically lack sophisticated facilities management teams, making them ideal candidates for outsourced cleaning services. Score boosted from base 65-70 to 78 due to proven OpenWorks presence and strong alignment with education sector success patterns."
6116,Other Schools and Instruction,72,"Strong fit for multi-location operators like tutoring centers, test prep chains, driving schools, and specialized instruction facilities. OpenWorks has proven success with 3 locations generating $4,660 revenue, demonstrating these businesses outsource cleaning as a non-core function. The massive 160,889 location market offers significant expansion potential, though individual facilities tend to be smaller than K-12 schools, requiring focus on multi-location chains for efficiency."
6117,Educational Support Services,72,"Educational Support Services shows proven OpenWorks success with 6 locations generating $16K revenue, demonstrating outsourcing viability in this sector. These facilities (tutoring centers, test prep, educational consultants) typically operate as multi-location businesses with standard commercial cleaning needs and no specialized requirements. Score reflects moderate fit - proven outsourcing but smaller facility footprints ($2,741/building suggests modest-sized locations) and fragmented market with many single-location operators, though the 62K+ nationwide locations offer scale opportunity for multi-location chains."
6211,Offices of Physicians,78,"Strong fit with proven OpenWorks success across 19 locations demonstrating physician practices outsource cleaning as non-core. Multi-location medical practices (group practices, specialty clinics) align well with ICP - high hygiene standards, operational facilities, and centralized decision-making. Score boosted by proven revenue (+5 points) and healthcare outsourcing patterns, though capped below 80 due to fragmented market with many single-location practices and some larger groups having internal facilities management."
6212,Offices of Dentists,72,"Dental offices show proven OpenWorks success with 33 locations served, demonstrating this industry outsources cleaning as a non-core function. The $900/building revenue and 17% margin indicate sustainable operations, though individual practices are typically single-location (limiting multi-location fit). Score boosted to 72 from base ~60 due to proven revenue and high hygiene standards that favor professional cleaning services, but capped below 75 as most dental practices are standalone rather than multi-location groups that represent OpenWorks' ideal profile."
6213,Offices of Other Health Practitioners,85,"Strong proven success with $441K revenue across 291 locations demonstrates excellent outsourcing fit. Multi-location medical practices (dental, chiropractic, physical therapy, optometry) align perfectly with OpenWorks' sweet spot: non-core cleaning needs, high hygiene standards, operational facilities without sophisticated FM departments. The massive 2.4M+ location market with proven $1,517/building economics and healthy 14.6% margins makes this a top-tier strategic opportunity."
6214,Outpatient Care Centers,85,"Strong proven success with $1.5M revenue across 601 locations demonstrates excellent outsourcing fit. Outpatient care centers are multi-location healthcare facilities with high hygiene standards but less complex than hospitals, making them ideal for standardized commercial cleaning services. The 14.6% profit margin and $2,562/building revenue shows sustainable operations, and the 66,122 total US locations represents significant expansion opportunity beyond current 1% market penetration."
6215,Medical and Diagnostic Laboratories,68,"Medical and diagnostic laboratories represent a moderate-fit opportunity with proven OpenWorks success ($9,870 revenue, 3 locations). While the industry outsources cleaning as non-core and has multi-location operators, many labs have specialized cleaning requirements (biohazard protocols, sterile environments, regulatory compliance) that exceed standard commercial cleaning capabilities. The proven revenue demonstrates some labs have standard office/administrative areas suitable for OpenWorks, but growth potential is limited by technical requirements in testing/processing areas and competition from specialized medical cleaning providers."
6216,Home Health Care Services,45,"Home health care services present significant challenges for OpenWorks' model. These are typically small, dispersed office locations (not operational facilities) serving as administrative bases for field staff, with minimal facility footprints and cleaning needs. The fragmented nature (91K+ locations suggests many small operators), lack of any proven OpenWorks success despite healthcare adjacency, and minimal facility complexity make this a poor strategic fit compared to operational healthcare facilities like outpatient centers or multi-location medical practices."
6219,Other Ambulatory Health Care Services,72,"Strong fit with proven OpenWorks success serving 5 locations generating $9.4K revenue. This industry includes outpatient care facilities, diagnostic labs, and ambulatory surgical centers that typically outsource cleaning as non-core - these are operational healthcare facilities without the complex internal FM teams of large hospitals. The massive 228K+ location market offers significant expansion potential, though some specialized facilities (surgical centers, diagnostic imaging) may have technical requirements that limit addressable market to ~60% of locations."
6221,General Medical and Surgical Hospitals,68,"OpenWorks has proven success with $98K revenue across 39 hospital locations, demonstrating that some hospitals do outsource cleaning. However, general hospitals typically have internal facilities management teams, union considerations, and complex procurement processes that limit scalability. The proven revenue earns a +10 bonus, but the industry cap of 70 for hospitals reflects the challenging nature of this market - success exists but expansion is constrained by internal staffing preferences and institutional complexity."
6222,Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals,68,"Psychiatric and substance abuse hospitals represent a moderate-to-good fit as healthcare facilities that often outsource cleaning as a non-core function, similar to outpatient care centers and specialty hospitals where OpenWorks has proven success. However, the zero current presence despite 51,136 locations nationwide is a concerning signal - these facilities may have specialized infection control protocols, behavioral health safety requirements, or internal staffing models that reduce outsourcing likelihood. The score reflects healthcare facility potential tempered by lack of proven success and possible specialized requirements beyond standard commercial cleaning."
6223,Specialty (except Psychiatric and Substance Abuse) Hospitals,72,"Specialty hospitals represent a moderate-to-strong fit with proven OpenWorks presence demonstrating outsourcing viability. These facilities are more likely to outsource than general hospitals (6221) due to smaller scale and focused operations, though some may have internal staff or complex procurement processes. The 5,952 nationwide locations provide reasonable market size, and specialty hospitals typically have standard commercial cleaning needs without the union considerations or massive internal FM departments common in large general hospitals."
6231,Nursing Care Facilities (Skilled Nursing Facilities),58,"Nursing care facilities present a moderate opportunity with mixed signals. While they are multi-location operators with high hygiene standards who do outsource cleaning (evidenced by the large market), the complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 91,436 locations nationwide is a significant red flag. Many skilled nursing facilities have internal housekeeping staff due to specialized infection control protocols, union considerations, and the need for staff trained in healthcare-specific cleaning standards, making this a challenging market to penetrate despite theoretical fit."
6232,Residential Intellectual and Developmental Disability Facilities,68,"Residential care facilities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities represent a moderate fit with proven OpenWorks success (2 locations, $3,232 revenue). These facilities require consistent cleaning standards for health/safety but often operate with limited budgets and may have some internal staff for basic maintenance. The small revenue per building ($1,616) suggests either small facilities or limited scope contracts, and the relatively small national footprint (1,729 locations) limits scalability compared to larger healthcare segments."
6233,Continuing Care Retirement Communities and Assisted Living Facilities,62,"Moderate fit with mixed signals. These facilities have consistent cleaning needs and often operate multiple locations, but the healthcare component introduces regulatory complexity (infection control, specialized protocols) that may require capabilities beyond standard commercial cleaning. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 89,493 locations suggests either high internal staffing rates or specialized requirements that don't align with core competencies. The assisted living component is more promising than skilled nursing, but lack of proven success warrants cautious approach."
6239,Other Residential Care Facilities,72,"Strong fit for OpenWorks with proven success serving residential care facilities (group homes, assisted living, halfway houses). These are multi-location operators with 24/7 operations requiring consistent cleaning standards for resident safety and regulatory compliance, and they typically outsource cleaning as a non-core function. The 17,178 nationwide locations represent significant expansion opportunity, though some larger facilities may have internal staff - focus on smaller to mid-sized operators (2-20 locations) without sophisticated FM departments."
6241,Individual and Family Services,85,"Strong proven success with $60K revenue across 21 locations demonstrates solid outsourcing likelihood in this community-serving sector. Individual and family services facilities (counseling centers, social service agencies, community programs) are operational environments where cleaning is non-core, often multi-location nonprofits or regional operators without sophisticated FM departments. The 15% margin and consistent $2,892/building revenue indicates sustainable fit, though the fragmented nature (835K+ locations) suggests many single-location operators requiring careful targeting for multi-location accounts."
6242,"Community Food and Housing, and Emergency Services",72,"Strong strategic fit as community-serving facilities with operational, utilitarian cleaning needs similar to proven success in social services (6241) and daycare (6244). These are multi-location nonprofits and community organizations that outsource cleaning as non-core, lack sophisticated FM departments, and prioritize cost-effective service over prestige cleaning. Zero current presence is notable but not disqualifying given the operational nature and similarity to adjacent proven categories - likely represents genuine untapped opportunity in the community services sector."
6243,Vocational Rehabilitation Services,72,"Vocational rehabilitation services align well with OpenWorks' proven success in community/social services (6241 scored 65+). These facilities are operational/community-serving environments where cleaning is non-core, often multi-location operators (state/regional programs), and lack sophisticated internal FM teams. Zero current presence despite strong theoretical fit suggests untapped opportunity in a sector similar to proven daycare/social services success, though lack of proven track record prevents higher score."
6244,Child Day Care Services,88,"Child Day Care Services is a PROVEN SUCCESS market for OpenWorks with $178K revenue across 74 locations, demonstrating strong outsourcing patterns in this industry. Multi-location daycare operators (chains, franchises) are ideal customers - they view cleaning as non-core, require consistent hygiene standards across sites, and lack sophisticated internal FM teams. The combination of proven performance, 150K+ nationwide locations, operational facilities focus, and community-serving mission creates exceptional growth potential, with only minor deductions for typically smaller facility sizes and regional fragmentation limiting the score from elite tier."
7111,Performing Arts Companies,45,"Performing arts companies (theaters, dance companies, orchestras) typically operate single-location venues or have limited multi-location presence, falling short of OpenWorks' ideal 10+ facility profile. While venues require regular cleaning, many are small nonprofits with limited budgets, and larger performing arts centers often have internal facilities staff or specialized venue management contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 50K+ locations nationwide signals poor outsourcing fit - these are typically prestige venues with specific aesthetic/operational requirements rather than utilitarian operational facilities where OpenWorks excels."
7112,Spectator Sports,72,"Spectator sports venues (stadiums, arenas, sports complexes) represent a strong operational fit with 24/7 event schedules, large-footprint facilities, and utilitarian cleaning needs. While OpenWorks has minimal presence ($3,712 from 1 location), these facilities typically outsource cleaning as non-core and require round-the-clock support during event seasons. Score reflects solid operational alignment but limited proven success and potential competition from specialized venue cleaning contractors for major facilities."
7113,"Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events",68,"Event promoters operate venues and facilities requiring consistent cleaning (theaters, arenas, convention spaces), and OpenWorks has proven success with 2 locations generating revenue. However, the low revenue per building ($1,200/year) suggests these may be small venues or limited scope contracts, and the industry is fragmented with many single-location operators rather than the ideal multi-location chains. Score boosted to 68 from base ~55 due to proven outsourcing (+5 for revenue presence), but tempered by small contract sizes and likely limited multi-location consolidation opportunities in this highly fragmented market."
7114,"Agents and Managers for Artists, Athletes, Entertainers, and Other Public Figures",25,"This industry consists primarily of small professional service offices (talent agencies, sports agents, entertainment managers) that typically operate single-location or small multi-location businesses with minimal facility footprints. These are professional office environments that either handle cleaning internally or use local janitorial services, not the operational/industrial facilities where OpenWorks excels. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 3,731 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry does not outsource to commercial cleaning providers like OpenWorks - they're small professional offices, not the multi-location operational facilities in OpenWorks' sweet spot."
7115,"Independent Artists, Writers, and Performers",15,"Independent artists, writers, and performers typically work from home studios, small personal offices, or shared creative spaces - not multi-location commercial facilities requiring outsourced cleaning services. This industry consists of individual practitioners and small creative businesses that handle their own facility needs, with no evidence of outsourcing commercial cleaning. The fragmented nature (40,149 locations) indicates mostly solo practitioners rather than multi-location operators, making this a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks' business model."
7121,"Museums, Historical Sites, and Similar Institutions",72,"Museums and historical sites demonstrate proven outsourcing behavior with OpenWorks serving 4 locations generating $32K revenue, earning the +5 point proven success bonus and minimum score of 55. These are community-serving facilities with operational cleaning needs (galleries, exhibits, public spaces) that treat cleaning as non-core, though many are single-location institutions or have limited budgets. The moderate revenue per building ($8K) suggests smaller facilities, but the 15% margin and proven success indicate solid fit for multi-location museum systems, historical societies, and cultural institutions that lack internal facilities teams."
7131,Amusement Parks and Arcades,68,"Amusement parks and arcades represent operational entertainment facilities with high foot traffic requiring consistent cleaning (restrooms, food areas, gaming spaces). While similar to proven success in recreation venues (7139), the complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 8,465+ locations suggests potential barriers - many large parks have internal facilities teams, and smaller arcades may be single-location operators. Score reflects moderate potential but requires validation of multi-location operators and outsourcing patterns before major investment."
7132,Gambling Industries,72,"Gambling facilities (casinos, card rooms, racetracks) are 24/7 operational environments with high foot traffic and utilitarian cleaning needs, making cleaning a non-core support function likely to be outsourced. While some large casino resorts may have internal facilities teams, regional casinos and smaller gaming operations align well with OpenWorks' multi-location operational facility model. Zero current presence despite 8,000+ locations suggests untapped opportunity, though lack of proven success warrants cautious optimism rather than highest tier scoring."
7139,Other Amusement and Recreation Industries,85,"Strong proven success with $287K revenue across 37 locations demonstrates excellent fit. Entertainment/recreation facilities (bowling alleys, skating rinks, family entertainment centers, mini golf) are operational environments that outsource cleaning as non-core, often multi-location operators without sophisticated FM teams. The $7,771/building revenue and 15.2% margin confirm these are solid accounts with standard commercial cleaning needs, and the massive 289K location market offers significant expansion potential in a proven vertical."
7211,Traveler Accommodation,45,"Hotels and motels typically maintain internal housekeeping departments as a core operational function, making outsourcing unlikely for guest rooms. While back-of-house areas (lobbies, conference rooms, fitness centers) could be opportunities, the industry's reliance on hospitality-trained staff and brand standards creates barriers. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 144K+ locations signals this is not a natural outsourcing market - hotels view cleaning as core to guest experience rather than a non-core support function."
7212,RV (Recreational Vehicle) Parks and Recreational Camps,45,"RV parks and recreational camps present moderate challenges for OpenWorks' model. While many are multi-location chains (KOA, Thousand Trails), they typically have on-site staff handling basic cleaning of bathhouses, laundry facilities, and common areas as part of property operations. The seasonal nature of many camps, lower cleaning standards than commercial facilities, and tendency to use on-site maintenance staff rather than outsource make this a less attractive market despite the location count."
7213,"Rooming and Boarding Houses, Dormitories, and Workers Camps",68,"Moderate-to-strong fit for OpenWorks. Dormitories and workers' camps represent multi-unit facilities with operational cleaning needs (non-core function), similar to successful hospitality/lodging environments. However, zero current OpenWorks presence despite 6,108 locations suggests potential barriers: many may be single-location operators, have internal housekeeping staff (like hotels), or be institutional facilities (university dorms) with existing contracts. Score reflects operational fit but tempered by lack of proven success and likely competition from internal staff or hospitality-focused cleaning companies."
7223,Special Food Services,45,"Special Food Services (caterers, mobile food services, food contractors) presents significant challenges for OpenWorks. Zero current presence despite 133K+ locations is a RED FLAG - these businesses typically have small footprints, event-based/mobile operations, or internal cleaning as part of food safety protocols. The industry's fragmented nature (many small caterers), specialized food safety requirements, and lack of traditional multi-location facility operations make it a poor fit for OpenWorks' operational facility cleaning model."
7224,Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages),35,"Drinking places (bars, taverns, nightclubs) present significant challenges for OpenWorks' model: predominantly single-location independent operators rather than multi-location chains, highly fragmented ownership, and often owner-operated with irregular hours. While the 115K locations suggest scale, the lack of ANY OpenWorks presence despite being a cleaning-intensive environment signals poor outsourcing fit - most bars either handle cleaning internally with staff or use local janitorial services. The single-location, independent operator profile contradicts OpenWorks' sweet spot of multi-location businesses with centralized decision-making."
7225,Restaurants and Other Eating Places,68,"OpenWorks has proven success with $82K revenue across 12 restaurant locations, demonstrating outsourcing viability in this sector. However, restaurants present challenges: single-location operators dominate the market, cleaning is often handled internally by staff during off-hours, and multi-location chains typically have sophisticated facilities management or national contracts. Best opportunities are regional restaurant groups (10-50 locations) without internal FM teams, particularly fast-casual and QSR formats where cleaning is clearly non-core."
8111,Automotive Repair and Maintenance,45,"Automotive repair shops are typically single-location, owner-operated businesses that rarely outsource cleaning as they handle it internally or have minimal facility maintenance needs. The $307 revenue from 1 location indicates extremely limited engagement, suggesting this industry views cleaning as something staff can handle rather than a service to outsource. With 710,391 locations nationwide but virtually no OpenWorks penetration, this represents a fragmented market of small operators who don't fit the multi-location ICP profile."
8112,Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance,45,"Electronic repair shops are typically small, single-location operations (86,440 locations suggests fragmented market) focused on technical service work rather than multi-location operations. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 86K+ locations is a strong RED FLAG - these businesses likely handle cleaning internally or have minimal facility needs given small footprints. The technical nature of work (precision equipment) may require specialized cleaning protocols beyond standard commercial services, and the industry lacks the multi-location operational profile where OpenWorks succeeds."
8113,Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment Repair and Maintenance,62,"Moderate fit with proven but minimal OpenWorks presence ($2,365 from 1 location). These are operational/industrial facilities that outsource cleaning as non-core, which aligns with OpenWorks' strengths. However, the single-location nature of most repair shops (69,821 locations suggests fragmented market) conflicts with the multi-location ICP, and specialized equipment/industrial environments may require more technical cleaning than standard commercial services."
8114,Personal and Household Goods Repair and Maintenance,25,"Personal and household goods repair shops (shoe repair, watch repair, appliance repair, etc.) are predominantly single-location, owner-operated small businesses with minimal facility footprints - the opposite of OpenWorks' multi-location ICP. Zero current OpenWorks presence despite 200K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that these small retail/service shops either handle cleaning internally or represent such small contracts they don't align with OpenWorks' business model. The fragmented, mom-and-pop nature of this industry makes it strategically unattractive."
8121,Personal Care Services,48,"Despite proven OpenWorks success ($66K revenue, 59 locations), personal care services (salons, spas, barbershops) are predominantly single-location small businesses that handle cleaning internally or hire local cleaners. The very low revenue per building ($1,122) indicates small facilities with minimal cleaning needs. While the 621,999 locations suggest scale, these are typically owner-operated establishments without centralized decision-making, making them poor fits for OpenWorks' multi-location B2B model despite the existing footprint."
8122,Death Care Services,72,"Funeral homes and cemeteries represent a strong operational fit - they are multi-location businesses that outsource cleaning as a non-core function, with utilitarian facility needs (preparation rooms, chapels, offices) rather than specialized requirements. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 85,000+ locations suggests an untapped opportunity, though the fragmented nature of the industry (many single-location operators) and sensitivity around death care services may require careful market entry. Score reflects strong outsourcing likelihood and operational fit, moderated by lack of proven success and need to identify multi-location operators."
8123,Drycleaning and Laundry Services,35,"Despite minimal OpenWorks presence ($750 from 1 location), drycleaning/laundry services are typically single-location or small chains that handle their own facility cleaning as part of daily operations. These businesses have internal staff managing facility upkeep and are unlikely to outsource cleaning as they already operate in the cleaning/maintenance sector themselves. The 63,718 locations are predominantly small, independent operators rather than multi-location chains that fit OpenWorks' ideal profile."
8129,Other Personal Services,35,"This industry includes diverse personal services (pet care, dating services, parking lots, photo finishing, etc.) that are typically small, single-location operations with minimal facility footprints. The lack of any OpenWorks presence despite 255K+ locations signals these are not outsourcing-friendly businesses - most are owner-operated with simple cleaning needs handled internally. The fragmented nature and small facility sizes make this a poor strategic fit for OpenWorks' multi-location B2B model."
8131,Religious Organizations,68,"Religious organizations show proven OpenWorks success with 9 buildings served, demonstrating outsourcing willingness in this sector. However, the low revenue per building ($1,657) suggests smaller facilities or limited scope, and many religious organizations rely on volunteer labor or have tight budgets that limit commercial cleaning spend. The massive nationwide footprint (517K locations) offers scale potential, but most are single-location entities rather than the multi-location operators OpenWorks targets, and decision-making is often committee-based rather than centralized."
8132,Grantmaking and Giving Services,45,"Grantmaking and Giving Services organizations (foundations, charitable trusts) typically operate professional office environments with small administrative staffs and limited facility footprints. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 14,842 locations nationwide is a RED FLAG - these organizations likely have minimal cleaning needs, use local vendors for small offices, or are part of larger institutional facilities management. The professional office nature combined with complete absence of proven success suggests poor outsourcing fit and limited multi-location opportunity."
8133,Social Advocacy Organizations,45,"Social advocacy organizations typically operate smaller office spaces with limited budgets focused on mission work rather than facilities. While some larger advocacy groups may have multi-location presence, the sector generally consists of lean nonprofits that either handle cleaning internally with volunteers/staff or have minimal facility needs. Zero OpenWorks presence despite nearly 1M locations nationwide is a strong signal that this industry either doesn't outsource cleaning or prioritizes cost over professional services - not a strategic fit for OpenWorks' operational facility focus."
8134,Civic and Social Organizations,68,"Civic and social organizations (fraternal lodges, civic clubs, community centers, membership organizations) represent a moderate fit with significant multi-location potential. While these are community-serving facilities that typically outsource cleaning as non-core, the complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 332K+ locations suggests fragmented decision-making, smaller facility sizes, or budget constraints that may limit scalability. The industry aligns with OpenWorks' proven success in community facilities (similar to social services 6241), but lack of any current penetration warrants cautious optimism rather than aggressive pursuit."
8139,"Business, Professional, Labor, Political, and Similar Organizations",62,"Professional membership organizations (trade associations, chambers of commerce, labor unions, political organizations) typically operate single-location offices with modest cleaning needs. While OpenWorks has proven it can serve this sector (3 buildings, $6K revenue), the low revenue per building ($2K) and single-location nature of most organizations limits strategic attractiveness. These are typically small professional offices that may handle cleaning internally or use local providers rather than multi-location contracts that OpenWorks excels at."
9211,"Executive, Legislative, and Other General Government Support",72,"Government facilities represent a solid opportunity with proven OpenWorks success (4 buildings served), demonstrating that government entities do outsource cleaning services. The massive nationwide footprint (458K+ locations) includes municipal buildings, courthouses, and administrative offices that require standard commercial cleaning. Score capped at 72 due to procurement complexity (RFP processes, prevailing wage requirements, political considerations) and competition from specialized government contractors, though the existing revenue proves viability for smaller municipal contracts and county facilities without sophisticated internal FM departments."
9221,"Justice, Public Order, and Safety Activities",45,"Government facilities (courthouses, police stations, detention centers) typically have internal facilities management teams, union staff, and complex procurement processes requiring competitive bidding. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 140K+ locations nationwide is a strong signal that these facilities either maintain in-house cleaning staff or use government-specific contractors. While multi-location potential exists (county/state systems), the public sector procurement barriers, prevailing wage requirements, and preference for internal staff make this a challenging market for OpenWorks' commercial cleaning model."
9231,Administration of Human Resource Programs,45,"Government administrative offices with professional office environments and likely internal facilities management departments. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 31,747 locations is a strong signal that these agencies either handle cleaning internally or use government procurement contracts that favor large national providers. Government entities typically have complex procurement processes, union considerations, and established internal FM structures that make outsourcing to regional providers challenging."
9241,Administration of Environmental Quality Programs,45,"Government environmental agencies (EPA offices, state DEQ facilities, water quality labs) present significant challenges: complex procurement processes, budget constraints, potential security requirements, and often internal facilities staff or existing government service contracts. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 27,195 locations nationwide is a strong negative signal - government facilities typically don't outsource cleaning to regional providers like OpenWorks, preferring large national GSA contractors or internal staff. While some local environmental offices might outsource, the government procurement complexity and lack of proven success makes this a poor strategic fit."
9251,NAICS 9251 Industry,35,"NAICS 9251 appears to be a government administration code (likely Administration of Environmental Quality Programs based on the 925x series). Government facilities typically have complex procurement processes, internal facilities staff, union considerations, and security clearance requirements that make them challenging for commercial cleaning providers. The complete absence of OpenWorks presence despite 11,132 locations nationwide is a strong signal that this sector either doesn't outsource cleaning or has barriers to entry that don't align with OpenWorks' business model."
9261,Administration of Economic Programs,45,"Government economic program administration facilities (federal/state agencies managing economic development, employment services, business assistance) typically have internal facilities management teams, complex procurement processes, and union considerations that make outsourcing challenging. While OpenWorks has minimal presence ($1,205 from 1 building), this likely represents a small satellite office rather than a scalable opportunity - government agencies rarely outsource cleaning at scale due to procurement regulations, prevailing wage requirements, and preference for internal staff or large national GSA contractors."
9271,Space Research and Technology,35,"Space Research and Technology facilities require highly specialized cleaning protocols including cleanroom standards, security clearances, and contamination control far beyond standard commercial cleaning capabilities. The extremely small market size (388 locations nationwide) combined with government/defense contractor operations means facilities likely have internal teams or specialized contractors with security clearances. Zero OpenWorks presence despite operational facilities confirms this is outside core competency - these are technical environments requiring specialized expertise, not standard commercial cleaning."
9281,National Security and International Affairs,35,"National Security and International Affairs facilities (military bases, defense installations, federal security agencies) require security clearances, specialized protocols, and typically have internal facilities management or highly vetted contractors with government certifications. Zero OpenWorks presence despite 19,847 locations signals extremely low outsourcing likelihood - these are government-operated facilities with strict procurement processes, union considerations, and security requirements far beyond standard commercial cleaning. The lack of any proven success combined with specialized government contracting barriers makes this a poor strategic fit."
9999,NAICS 9999,0,"NAICS 9999 is not a valid industry code - it's a placeholder/catch-all code used for unclassified establishments or data errors. This represents miscoded businesses rather than a coherent industry segment, making it impossible to evaluate for strategic fit or develop a targeted market approach."
